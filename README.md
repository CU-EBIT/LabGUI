# LabGUI

Software for logging, monitoring, and controlling basic lab equipment

## Ways to use this

There are a few ways this can be implemented. Either via cloning the repository, and then simply making your own version of the example_run.py.

Another way is to add this repository to yours as a submodule. An example of this can be found at https://github.com/CU-EBIT/LabGUI-Example
